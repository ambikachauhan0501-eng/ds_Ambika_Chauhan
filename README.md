Web3 Trading Analysis: Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment
# Trader Behavior vs Market Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project investigates how trader behavior (profitability, risk, volume, leverage) aligns or diverges from overall market sentiment (Fear vs Greed).  
By combining historical trader data from Hyperliquid with the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index, the analysis uncovers hidden trends and signals that can inform smarter trading strategies in Web3 markets.
